# Interview Coding Problem - Repository Setup and Instructions

Welcome to our interview coding problem. In this exercise, we have provided you with a repository that contains two separate applications: a web application built with Next.js and a python backend application. 

Your task is to fork this repository, create a branch, and implement a solution to the problem outlined in [acceptance criteria](./acceptance-criteria.md).

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```
├── web/
│   ├── ... (Next.js web application files)
├── backend/
│   ├── ... (Backend application files)
├── .gitignore
└── README.md
└── acceptance-criteria.md  <- The assignment
```

- The `web/` directory contains the Next.js web application code
- The `backend/` directory contains a Python API

## Forking the Repository

To get started, you need to fork this repository to your own GitHub account. Follow these steps:

1. Visit the original repository on GitHub: https://github.com/gohoken/interview
2. Click on the "Fork" button in the top-right corner of the page
3. Choose your GitHub account to fork the repository into

Once you have successfully forked the repository, you will have a copy of it in your own GitHub account.

## Creating a Branch and Implementing the Solution

Now that you have your forked repository, it's time to create a branch and start working on the coding problem. Please follow these steps:

1. Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:gohoken/interview.git
   ```

2. Change into the repository's directory:
   ```
   cd interview
   ```

3. Create a new branch for your solution:
   ```
   git checkout -b solution
   ```

4. Implement your solution to the coding problem in [acceptance criteria](./acceptance-criteria.md). 
   Focus on providing a solution and demonstrating your thinking process.

5. Once you are satisfied with your solution, commit your changes:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Implemented solution to the coding problem"
   ```

6. Push the branch to your forked repository on GitHub:
   ```
   git push origin solution
   ```

## Time Expectations and Additional Improvements

We understand that your time is valuable, and we expect that implementing the solution and providing a sense of your thinking should not take longer than a few hours.

While the primary focus is on delivering a solution, we encourage you to feel free to make any additional changes or improvements that you would consider necessary to make the application production-ready. Please highlight those changes as either comments, commits or a separate document.

Remember, the primary goal is to showcase your problem-solving abilities and provide a glimpse into your thinking process.

Thank you for your time, and we look forward to reviewing your solution!
